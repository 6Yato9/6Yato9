## Hi there 👋

I'm Abdellah, a computer science student.

I build things with code, but when I’m not coding, I’m engineering, prototyping, and messing around with robotics.  
If an idea sticks in my head, I want to figure out how to make it real — software or hardware.  
Long term, I want to be an inventor, not just a programmer.

My work mostly lives at the intersection of logic, visuals, and experimentation.  
I enjoy creative coding, interactive web experiences, and projects that push beyond “just working.”

I mainly work with JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, and Three.js, with Python, C++ and c# for gamedev.  
Most of my projects are experiments, tools, or ideas I wanted to see exist.

I’ve got a few projects pinned below — each one started as a “what if?” moment.
