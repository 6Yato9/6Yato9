## Hi there 👋  
### I'm Abdellah

**Computer science student · builder · aspiring inventor**

---

I build things with code — but when I’m not coding, I’m engineering, prototyping, and messing around with **robotics**.  
If an idea sticks in my head, I want to figure out how to make it real, whether that’s **software or hardware**.

Long term, I don’t just want to be a programmer.  
I want to be an **inventor**.

---

My work lives at the intersection of **logic, visuals, and experimentation**.  
I enjoy creative coding, interactive web experiences, and projects that push beyond *“just working.”*

---

**Tech I usually reach for:**  
JavaScript · TypeScript · Next.js · Three.js  
Python · C++ · C# (game dev)

---

⬇️ A few projects are pinned below — each one started as a simple *“what if?”*
